  This is update for lxLite 1.33 distribution.

  Sorry, I'm too lazy to support entire nice packet with tonns of
icons, installers and so on.

  This is just update of single lxLite executable AND Windows version
of this executable.

  Update does not include any fixes :)
  Actually, I used it for some special development needs and had no
plans to publish it, but Windows version still can be useful, so here
it is :)

  Source code placed in src dir.
